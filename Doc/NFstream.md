# Detect application or website's name and category

## What we want to do?

### The target of this project is to know the name of the application and category of them with Machine Learning(ML) model and algorithms. For instance, when we search a steam in chrome our model should predict and tell use the application name is steam and category of that is game.

## How this task can be implement?

1. As we know, the first step in every ML tasks is to collect a dataset. So, for basic model I use [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/applicationdataset/applicationbasednetworktrafficdataset) dataset which has different categories such as : Telegram , Hotspotshield vpn , steam , spotify , ... and the format of them are pcap.
2. Due to, for analyzing pcap files we need a multiplatform Python framework which providing fast , flexible and expressive data structures designed to make working with network data easy and intuitive.
3. Next, we convert these files to CSV format to see all features that NFstream extracted from pcap files.
4.
